## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://youtu.be/BFyeuLhjcPY)

Your GitHub profile is an extremely important aspect of your public identity as a developer. A well-crafted one allows you to show off your work to other developers as well as potential employers. An important component of your GitHub profile‚Äîand one that many new developers often overlook‚Äîis the README.md file.

The quality of a README often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase what your application does, justify the technologies used, and even talk about some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future. A good README helps you stand out among the large crowd of developers putting their work on GitHub.

There's no one right way to structure a good README. There is one very wrong way, however, and that is to not include a README at all or to create a very anemic one. This guide outlines a few best practices. As you progress in your career, you will develop your own ideas about what makes a good README.

At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? 

Lastly, if your project is deployed, include a link to the deployed application here.

If you're new to Markdown, read the GitHub guide on [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

If you need an example of a good README, check out [the VSCode repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode).

## Code Refactor Example
The original HTML lacked semantic HTML elements and needed to be made more accessible.

```html
    </div>
    <div class="benefits">   
        <div class="benefit-lead">   
            <h3>Lead Generation</h3>
            <img src="./assets/images/lead-generation.png />
            <p>
                Inbound strategies for lead generation require less work for your business, bringing customers directly to your website.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="benefit-brand">  UPDATE TO SECTION
            <h3>Brand Awareness</h3>
            <img src="./assets/images/brand-awareness.png" />
            <p>
                Users find your business through paid and organic searches, increasing the search ranking and visibility for your business.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="benefit-cost">  
            <h3>Cost Management</h3>
            <img src="./assets/images/cost-management.png" />
            <p>
                As the search ranking for your business increases, your advertising costs decrease, and you no longer need to advertise your page.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

```

By reviewing semantic HTML elements, the nonsemantic elements were located and given the appropriate [<aside> semantic element](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) and descriptive alt attributes for the visually impaired.

```html
 <aside class="benefits"> <!--Renamed aside-->
        <div class="aside-links" id="benefit-lead">
            <h3>Lead Generation</h3>
            <img src="./assets/images/lead-generation.png" alt=‚Äùpicture of a funnel with items going in and resulting in money‚Äù/>
            <p>
                Inbound strategies for lead generation require less work for your business, bringing customers directly to your website.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="aside-links" id=benefit-brand">
            <h3>Brand Awareness</h3>
            <img src="./assets/images/brand-awareness.png" alt="picture of a person experiencing a lightbulb moment" />
            <p>
                Users find your business through paid and organic searches, increasing the search ranking and visibility for your business.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="aside-links" id=benefit-cost">
            <h3>Cost Management</h3>
            <img src="./assets/images/cost-management.png" alt=‚Äùpicture of gears and money symbols‚Äù />
            <p>
                As the search ranking for your business increases, your advertising costs decrease, and you no longer need to advertise your page.
            </p>
        </div>
    </aside>
```
The CSS was also updated to correct redundancy with the creation of new classes. The above section of HTML now has the following CSS (https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_class.php):

.aside-links {
    margin-bottom: 32px;
    color: #ffffff;
}
.aside-links h3 {
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    text-align: center;
}
.aside-links img {
    display: block;
    margin: 10px auto;
    max-width: 150px;


To provide contrast for the visually impaired, the CSS was also updated in the header section: 

```css
.header h1 .seo {
    color: darkgray;
}
```


## Usage 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed. 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

```md
![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
```


## Learning Points 


This is a good place to Explain what you Learned by creating this application.
This is a great way to remind about all of the Complex Skills you now have.
If the user is less experienced than you:
They will be impressed by what you can do!

If the user is more experienced than you:
They will be impressed by what you can do!

Remember, it is easy to forget exactly how Valuable and Impressive your skills are, as well as How Much You‚Äôve Learned!
So quantify that here!

The user has looked through your whole README, and gotten familiar with your application. 
This is where you take credit, and make it easy for them to learn more about you!
Direct them to the following:
- Your GitHub Profile
- Your LinkedIn
- Your Portfolio Website
- And Anything Else You Want!

Give credit where credit is due! 

If you Pseudocode or Pair Program with someone else, give them kudos in your Contributors section!


## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.


## License

The last section of a good README is a license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, use [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/)

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them there.

## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
